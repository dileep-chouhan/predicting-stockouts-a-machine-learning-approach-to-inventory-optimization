# Predicting Stockouts: A Machine Learning Approach to Inventory Optimization

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for inventory optimization, focusing on minimizing stockouts.  The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to forecast demand and determine optimal reorder points.  This reduces lost sales due to insufficient inventory and improves overall customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of key findings.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


**Example Output:**

The script will print key performance indicators (KPIs) to the console, including model accuracy metrics and optimized reorder point calculations.  Additionally, the project generates several visualizations, saved as PNG files in the `output` directory. These include, but are not limited to, plots illustrating sales trends over time and the performance of the prediction model.  For example, you will find a file named `sales_trend.png` showing the historical sales data and the model's predictions.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data used for model training and evaluation.
* `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
* `models/`: May contain trained model files (depending on implementation).
* `output/`: Stores generated plots and other output files.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
* `main.py`: The main script to run the analysis.
